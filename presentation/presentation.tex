  \begin{frame}{Virtualization vs. Containers}
      Hardware virtualization virtualizes a complete machine such that a full operating system is running as a guest on top of a host operating system. \newline

      Containers are an application of operating system virtualization in which isolated user spaces are created on top of the same operating system and thus share the kernel. \newline

      Containers are used as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines and are very useful when deploying and running applications in clustered environments.
