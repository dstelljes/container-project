# Software Containers

Prior to World War II, most international shipments were strapped to pallets or loaded in crates or bags. Cargo would be delivered to a warehouse near the dock and each piece would be individually loaded onto the ship. After the ship had reached its destination, each piece would be individually unloaded into another warehouse.

The break bulk system worked for most of the history of shipping, but it was far from optimal. Loading and unloading ships was a time-consuming process that required specialized equipment and involved hundreds of people. Cargo was often damaged and occasionally stolen, and ships had to be thoroughly cleaned between loads.

[Shipping containers][intermodal-containers] addressed those problems (and revolutionized the shipping industry) by antiquating the idea of individual pieces of cargo. Standardized containers eliminated the need for warehouses and large dock crews and introduced enormous improvements in efficiency, simplicity, and safety.

Software containers do for application deployment what shipping containers do for freight. Instead of relying on complicated scripts to prepare the deployment environment, software developers can pack configuration and dependencies into a container and be assured that the application will run correctly.

## About this book

This book is an ongoing project by [Shawn Seymour][shawn] and [Dan Stelljes][dan] that began as part of a semester-long directed study on software containers at the University of Minnesota Morris. The book aims to achieve the following goals:

*   Provide a comprehensive record of what we learned over the course of the semester.

*   Offer general guidance on different pieces of container software and examples of common use cases.

*   Demonstrate some real-world applications of containerization for use at Morris and elsewhere.
