# Container Use Cases

Containers are useful in a variety of educational and real-world settings.

## Web applications

The most common use of software containers is using them to host web applications and services. Containers allow for scaling websites without utilizing resource-hungry virtual machines or large amounts of hardware. It allows for modularity within the deployment of applications by splitting up the parts of the application (i.e. the server and database).

Large companies utilizing containers for web applications include:
*   **[Google][google]:** Google uses over [two billion containers a week][google1] to serve its web applications and back-end services. Google has stated they use containers and container management systems for almost all of their services at this point.
*   **[Paypal][paypal]:** Paypal utilizes its own private cloud and [Docker's commericial solutions][paypal1] to provide the tools needed to run a large-scale and secure web application to over 190 markets and 24 currencies. Paypal also uses Docker extensively within their development processes.
*   **[Uber][uber]:** Uber, the well-known transportion service, [utilizes Docker][uber1] for both build and production environments. It allows them to update certain things without rebooting their entire fleet as they did before onboarding to Docker.
